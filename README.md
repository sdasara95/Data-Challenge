# Data-Challenge
We appreciate the time that all applicants put into this exercise and to ensure we give it the proper attention, a member of the data science team carefully looks through each submission and evaluates it. Due to an increased volume of applicants, it may take the team a few days to get back to you with next steps. 


Exercise
*Please use Python <br>
The attached CSV file lists the customer, date, and dollar value of orders placed at a store in 2017. The actual gender and predicted gender of each customer is also provided.<br>

Complete each of the following activities in a jupyter notebook using Python. Put your name and email at the top of the notebook and include your name in the notebook file name. Send back only your notebook file and please do not zip it. Please do not exclude $0 orders.

### A) Assemble a dataframe with one row per customer and the following columns:

* customer_id
* gender
* most_recent_order_date
* order_count (number of orders placed by this customer)
Sort the dataframe by customer_id ascending and display the first 10 rows.

### B) Plot the count of orders per week for the store.

### C) Compute the mean order value for gender 0 and for gender 1. Do you think the difference is significant? Justify your choice of method.

### D) Generate a confusion matrix for the gender predictions of customers in this dataset. You can assume that there is only one gender prediction for each customer. What does the confusion matrix tell you about the quality of the predictions?

### E) Describe one of your favorite tools or techniques and give a small example of how it's helped you solve a problem. Limit your answer to one paragraph, and please be specific.

For each question, state any considerations or assumptions you made.
